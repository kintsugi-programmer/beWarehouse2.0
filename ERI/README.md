### Extended Reality (XR)
- XR is an umbrella term for technologies that blend the physical and virtual worlds.  
- Key components include VR, AR, and MR.

#### Virtual Reality (VR)
- Completely artificial environment experienced via computer-generated sensory stimuli (sight, sound).  
- Provides *immersive experience* enabling navigation and interaction in 3D spaces.  
- Users’ actions influence the environment dynamically.

#### Augmented Reality (AR)
- Enhances reality by overlaying digital information onto the physical world.  
- Usually accessed via smartphone cameras or smart glasses.  
- Virtual objects appear integrated into the real-world scene.

#### Mixed Reality (MR)
- Combines AR and VR by allowing interaction between physical and virtual objects in real time.  
- Virtual and real objects coexist and can be manipulated interactively.

### History of Virtual Reality

- **1838:** Charles Wheatstone demonstrated depth perception using stereoscopic photos viewed through a stereoscope, creating a 3D illusion by presenting slightly different images to each eye.  
- **1929:** Edward Link created the first commercial flight simulator ("Link Trainer")—an electromechanical device mimicking turbulence and aircraft motion.   
- **1950s:** Morton Heilig developed the Sensorama, an arcade-style multi-sensory theatre.  
- **1960:** Heilig invented the Telesphere Mask, the first head-mounted display (HMD) with stereoscopic 3D and stereo sound but without motion tracking.  
- **1961:** Philco engineers created the Headsight, the first motion-tracking HMD linked to remote camera viewing—used mainly for military applications.  
- **1968:** Ivan Sutherland and Bob Sproull developed the Sword of Damocles, the first computer-connected VR HMD, which was bulky and suspended from the ceiling.  
- **1987:** Jaron Lanier coined the term "virtual reality" and developed early VR devices including data gloves and HMDs.  
- **1997:** VR was used for PTSD treatment for war veterans by Georgia Tech and Emory University.  
- **2007 onward:** Mass adoption begins, with Google Street View (360-degree imagery), Oculus Rift Kickstarter in 2012, and later commercial VR products (HTC Vive, Oculus Quest, Microsoft HoloLens).

- **Virtual Reality (VR):** Fully immersive digital environments.
- **Augmented Reality (AR):** Overlaying virtual elements on the real world.
- **Mixed Reality (MR):** Blending real and virtual worlds interactively.

***

### Haptic Technology

Haptics add the *sense of touch* to XR to make experiences more immersive.

#### Types of Haptic Feedback

- **Kinesthetic:** Senses force and motion involving muscles and joints. Simulates size and density of objects through physical sensations.
- **Tactile:** Relates to skin sensations such as vibration, surface texture, temperature, and pressure.

#### Devices and Application

- Kinesthetic devices use motors or actuators to simulate forces.
- Tactile devices use vibrations or temperature changes on the skin.
  
Examples of haptic feedback implementation include VR controllers that provide force feedback or mobile phone vibrations.

***

### Tracking in XR

Tracking is essential to synchronize physical and virtual environments by detecting position and orientation of objects in real-time.

#### Tracking Types

- **Head Tracking:** Tracks the position/orientation of the HMD.
- **Hand Tracking:** Tracks hand movements and gestures.
- **Eye Tracking:** Detects gaze direction for interaction and foveated rendering.
- **Full Body Tracking:** Tracks the entire body’s movements.
- **Object Tracking:** Detects and tracks other physical objects.

***

### Degrees of Freedom (DoF) in Tracking

Degrees of Freedom define the types of movements a device can track.

#### 3DoF (Three Degrees of Freedom)

- Tracks rotational movements only:
  - **Roll:** Tilting head side to side.
  - **Pitch:** Nodding head up/down.
  - **Yaw:** Turning head left/right.
- Does **not** track translational movement (walking, sidestepping).

#### 6DoF (Six Degrees of Freedom)

- Tracks rotational and translational movements:
  - Rotation: Roll, Pitch, Yaw.
  - Translation: Moving forward/backward (surge), left/right (strafe), up/down (elevate).
- Enables full 3D movement and immersive interaction in virtual spaces.
