## Digital Audio – Lecture 1 Notes  
### (Detailed, Simple Language in Markdown)

### **What is Sound?**
- **Sound** is a pressure wave created by a vibrating object.
- These vibrations move particles (like in air), which carry energy as sound.
- Example:
  - Pleasant: Speech, music.
  - Unpleasant: Machinery, traffic noise.

***

### **How Does the Ear Work?**
- The ear has three main parts: **Outer Ear, Middle Ear, Inner Ear**
  - **Outer Ear:** Collects sound and pushes it into the ear canal.
  - **Ear Drum:** Vibrates when sound waves hit it.
  - **Middle Ear:** Three small bones (Malleus, Incus, Stapes) pass along these vibrations.
  - **Inner Ear:** Vibrations reach the cochlea, which turns them into electrical signals for the brain via the auditory nerve.
- Other important parts: Semicircular canals (balance), Eustachian tube (pressure balance), facial and vestibular nerves.

***

### **Brief History of Sound Recording**
1. **First Recording (1857)**  
   - Invented by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, France.
2. **Phonograph (1877)**
   - Invented by Thomas Edison in the USA.
   - Recorded and played sound using a tin-foil cylinder.
   - Purely mechanical process.
3. **Gramophone/Turntable (1887)**
   - Invented by Emile Berliner.
   - Used flat discs (records), not cylinders.
4. **Vacuum Tube Amplifier (1906)**
   - Invented by Lee De Forest.
   - Boosted audio signals electronically.
5. **Optical Film Recording (1922)**
   - Sound was captured on film as optical signals.
6. **Tape Recording (1930s)**
   - Developed in Germany.
   - Used tape coated with magnetic material ("Magnetophons").
   - **Analog:** The tape waveform resembled the original sound.

***

### **From Analog to Digital**
- **Analog**: Records a continuous sound wave (like the original).
- **Digital Sound Recording**: Turns the audio signal into numbers using a method called **Sampling**.

#### **Digital Audio: Sampling Concept**
- **Sampling** means measuring (sampling) the height of a sound wave at very rapid time intervals.
- Converts a smooth, continuous wave into lots of tiny dots or numbers.

#### **Nyquist (Sampling) Theorem**
- To capture a sound accurately:
  - The **sampling rate** (how fast we sample) must be at least **twice** the highest frequency present in the sound.
  - If sampling is less, parts of the sound will be missed or distorted (**aliasing**).
- Formula:  
  $$ F_s \geq 2 \times f_{max} $$  
  Where $$F_s$$ = sampling rate (in Hz), $$f_{max}$$ = highest frequency in the audio.

***

### **Standards in Digital Audio**
- **Audio Engineering Society (AES):**
  - Sets professional standards for digital audio.
- **Common Sampling Frequencies:**
  - **44.1 kHz (CD quality)**
  - **48 kHz (used in video production)**
  - **32 kHz (radio broadcasting)**
- **Bit Depth:** Indicates how many numbers are used per sample (e.g., 16 bits for CD, 24 bits for high-res audio).

***

### **Growth of Digital Audio**
- **Public Release:** Digital audio reached the public in 1982 with Compact Discs (CDs), created by Sony & Philips.
- **Modern Standards:** We now have very high-quality sound files:
  - Example: 96kHz sampling rate, 24 bits per sample (used for "hi-res" audio).

***

### **Comparing Audio Outputs**
- **Devices through History:**
  - Gramophone
  - Vacuum Tube Radio
  - Spool Machine (reel-to-reel tape)
  - Cassette Player
  - Modern High-Res Audio File

#### **Main Points of Comparison**
- **Audio Output:** How the final sound comes out.
- **Fidelity:** Clarity and accuracy of the sound compared to the original.
- **Amplitude/Dynamics:** Range from soft to loud sounds.

***

### **Key Takeaways**
- Audio technology started from simple mechanical devices and now uses complex digital methods.
- **Digital audio** relies on sampling and bit depth for sound quality.
- Good audio depends on *how* it's recorded and *how many details* (frequency and dynamic range) are captured.

### **Digital Representation of Analog Sound**

- **Digital Audio** means converting a smooth (analog) sound wave into numbers.
- This is done by *sampling* the waveform at regular time intervals.
- The number of samples taken per second is the **sampling rate** (measured in Hertz, Hz).

***

### **Sampling, Reconstruction & Aliasing**

#### **Sampling:**
- When you record sound digitally, you "capture" the signal at fixed time intervals.
- Each capture is called a **sample**.
- The higher the sampling rate, the more detail you capture.

#### **Reconstruction:**
- To play back the sound, these samples are converted back to an analog signal.
- If samples don’t match the original wave (due to low sampling rate), reconstruction won't be accurate.

#### **Aliasing (Foldover):**
- **Aliasing** is a form of distortion.
- It happens when the sampling rate is too low to accurately capture the original wave.
- Result: You get a *false* or *incorrect* sound frequency when played back.
- *Example:*  
  - Sampling a fast (high-frequency) wave too slowly might make it sound like a completely different, slower (lower-frequency) wave.

***

### **Nyquist Theorem / Sampling Theorem**

- To capture all details of a sound:
  - The sampling rate must be **at least twice** the highest frequency in the audio.
  - Formula:  
    $$ Fs \geq 2 \times f_{max} $$
  - $$Fs$$ = Sampling rate  
    $$f_{max}$$ = Highest frequency present

- **Why?**
  - If you sample too slowly (< 2fmax), some sound details are lost or recorded incorrectly (aliasing).

#### **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):**
- Uses a clock or pulse generator to decide when to sample the signal.

***

### **Sampling Examples:**

- **Sampling 1 time per cycle** (too slow): The sine wave may appear as a straight line—a constant!
- **Sampling 1.5 times per cycle**: The wave looks like a lower-frequency signal—not what was really there.
- **Sampling 2 times per cycle (Nyquist Rate)**: You get the wave correctly; no important information is lost.

***

### **Dynamic Range in Digital Audio**

#### **What is Dynamic Range?**
- The *range* between the loudest and softest sounds a system can handle.
- Measured in **decibels (dB)**.

#### **What is a Decibel (dB)?**
- Not a direct unit of volume, but a ratio (comparison) of two levels.
- Uses a **logarithmic scale**: Each increase means a much bigger actual change.
- 0 dB = softest sound a person can hear (reference level)

#### **Examples of Sound Intensity in dB:**
| Description                 | Approximate dB Level |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Rocket launch               | 180 dB               |
| Jet engine (take-off)       | 140 dB               |
| Rock band                   | 120 dB               |
| Loud thunder                | 110 dB               |
| City traffic                | 90 dB                |
| Loud radio                  | 80 dB                |
| Ordinary conversation       | 60 dB                |
| Soft whisper                | 30 dB                |
| Softest human hearing       | 0 dB                 |

*Note: Each increase of 10 dB means the sound is about 10 times more powerful!*

***

### **Key Points to Remember**

- **Proper sampling** (at least twice the highest frequency) is needed to record audio accurately.
- **Aliasing** is bad: happens if you don’t sample fast enough.
- **Dynamic range** tells you how loud and how soft sounds the system can capture or play.
- **Decibels** help us compare loudness, but are a relative measure, not absolute “volume.”

***

*Tip: You can experiment with different frequencies using a mobile frequency generator.*
