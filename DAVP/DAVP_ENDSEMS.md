Answer Key

1. The Nyquist Theorem states that the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest analog frequency component (Fs >= 2fmax) for lossless digitization. If the sampling rate is less than this, some of the highest frequency components will not be correctly represented in the digitized output. This undesirable condition is a form of distortion known as aliasing or foldover.
2. In a three-point lighting setup, the Key Light acts as the primary light source, similar to the sun. The Fill Light, typically at half the intensity of the key, is used to soften shadows created by the key light. The Back Light, usually at the same intensity as the key, casts a rim of light on the subject to separate them from the background.
3. The Kuleshov effect is a principle of intellectual montage where emotion is evoked through the juxtaposition of contrasting images. The goal is to create a montage where the combination of shots (e.g., a neutral face followed by a bowl of soup, a coffin, or a woman) would evoke a different emotional response each time, such as hunger, sadness, or desire, respectively.
4. Deep Space creates the illusion of a three-dimensional world on a two-dimensional screen by using depth cues like longitudinal planes, perspective, and vanishing points. In contrast, Flat Space emphasizes the two-dimensionality of the screen by eliminating perspective, staging objects on a single frontal plane, and using camera moves like pans and zooms that do not create relative movement.
5. A compressor is an audio processing tool that manages the dynamics of a sound by reducing the difference between its loudest and quietest parts. The "threshold" parameter sets the specific volume level at which the compressor becomes active; only when a signal's level goes above this threshold will it be compressed.
6. The aperture is the opening in the lens that light passes through, and its size is measured in f-stops. A lower f-stop number (e.g., f/2) corresponds to a larger aperture opening, which results in a shallower Depth of Field (less of the scene is in focus). A higher f-stop number (e.g., f/22) means a smaller aperture, resulting in a greater Depth of Field (more of the scene is in focus).
7. Act One introduces the world and characters and identifies the central problem or "point A." Act Two, the longest act, focuses on the protagonist's efforts to confront and deal with this problem. Act Three brings the story to its conclusion by showing how the problem is ultimately resolved, reaching "point B."
8. Gain refers to the input level of an audio signal, used to bring a signal up to a usable level before processing. Volume refers to the output level of the signal after it has been processed, controlling its overall loudness. In simple terms, gain gets the signal in properly, while volume controls how loud it comes out.
9. A Cardioid microphone primarily picks up sound from the front and sides while being acoustically dead at the rear. This unidirectional pattern makes it ideal for live situations to prevent feedback from stage monitors. It is also widely used in studios for recording sources like vocals, guitars, and drums.
10. B-roll consists of visuals that illustrate the story being told in the A-roll (the main footage, such as a talking head interview). On the editing timeline, B-roll clips are placed on a video track above the A-roll track, so that they take priority and cover the video below them at specific points to add visual context.
