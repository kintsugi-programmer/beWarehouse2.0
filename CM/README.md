| Project          | 25%    |

*Quizzes:* “n-1 policy” (miss one without penalty).

*Projects* and *activities* are central—learn by doing.

***

### 4. **Academic Integrity**
- *What counts as plagiarism:*
  - Copying homework.
  - Using someone else’s work/ideas without citation.
- *Consequences:*
  - First time: Zero marks.
  - Second time: Reported to committee.
  - If in the final report: Grade goes down by one.

***

### 5. **Biological Systems Are Unique**
- **Features:**
  - Adaptive, self-organizing, constantly changing, oscillatory, far from equilibrium, sensitive, not always optimal.
- *Physical efficiency* (like perfect networks in lungs) can actually make a system more fragile—not always optimal for health (example: bronchial tree and asthma).

***

### 6. **Interdisciplinary Nature**
- This field combines computer science, biology, medicine, and social science.
- Inspired by coursework/programs at Stanford, Harvard, Melbourne, and others.

***

### 7. **Uses of Health Data**
- **Applications:**
  - Individual care (diagnosis/treatment)
  - Public health planning
  - Policy evaluation
  - Improving safety, cost-effectiveness, outcomes
- *Same data* can answer different questions—depends on how/why it is used.

***

### 8. **Types of Medical Studies**
- **Retrospective:** Look back at old records.
- **Prospective:** Start now, collect data moving forward.

***

### 9. **Why Data Science Is Important in Health**
- Helps:
  - Identify risk factors (e.g., cholesterol → heart disease).
  - Control for “confounders”, *hidden factors* that can mislead results.
- *Simpson’s Paradox:* Trends in subgroups may be opposite to the whole population. Need care in data interpretation.

***

### 10. **Types of Data Analysis Problems**
- Must think about *causality*: What causes what?
- *Forks (confounding):* Multiple factors affect a result.
- *Colliders:* Sometimes including too many variables hides real effects.

***

### 11. **AI Failures**
- **Common failures:**
  - Biased data (e.g., only light skin in melanoma training data).
  - Human error.
  - Regulatory issues.
  - Over-trusting complex, “black box” models.
  - Disinformation via AI tools.

- *Case Study:* An AI learned that pneumonia patients with asthma had better survival, but only because they got better care—not because asthma was protective.

***

### 12. **Making Data FAIR**
| Principle              | What it means                                                                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Findable               | Data has a persistent unique identifier, rich metadata                       |
| Accessible             | Data can be retrieved with standard protocols, metadata always available     |
| Interoperable          | Data uses shared vocabularies and formats                                    |
| Reusable               | Data has clear licenses, provenance, and meets community standards           |

***

### 13. **Major Example Health Datasets**
- *CORD-19*: COVID-19 scholarly articles dataset.
- *MIMIC-III*: ICU patient data (demographics, labs, notes).
- *Johns Hopkins COVID* datasets: For specific clinical research.
- *Vivli*: Clinical trials and antimicrobial resistance data.

*Most are open to global researchers for free and used for real-world experiments and studies.*

***

### 14. **Key Takeaways**
- Computing can transform how medicine is practiced, but ethical, safe, and reproducible ways of handling data are critical.
- Interdisciplinary skills are necessary: programming, statistics, domain knowledge.
- Real-world datasets are available to explore and build medical AI and tools.
- Always consider data limitations and risk of bias.
- Plagiarism carries heavy consequences—always cite and do your own work.

## Computing for Medicine, Lecture 2: The Big Picture (Continued)
*(Based on C4M-Lecture-2_Big_Picture_Contd.pptx_compressed.pdf)*

***

### 1. **Case Study: Simpson’s Paradox in Vaccine Data**
- **Data Example:** COVID-19/Israeli Data (Aug 2021)
  - **Age Groups:** All ages, Under 50, Over 50
  - **Vaccine Efficacy:** 
    - Efficacy appears high in each age group for vaccinated people.
    - But “overall” efficacy looks much lower.
  - **Cause:** Older people (at higher risk) are more vaccinated.
- **Concept:**  
  - *Simpson’s Paradox* — When trends are present in separate groups but disappear or reverse when groups are combined.
  - **Moral:** Always stratify data and check subgroups before drawing conclusions.

***

### 2. **Digitizing Human Health: Challenges**
- **Real World:** Health is *continuous* (analogue signals), e.g., heart rate, blood pressure.
- **Computing World:** Works with *digital* (discrete numbers, finite precision).
- **Implication:** Computational models always approximate real health data—never fully capture all details.

***

### 3. **Types of Medical Studies: Recap**
- **Retrospective Study:** Looks back at existing records.  
  *Example: Checking past patient histories to find links between exposure and disease.*
- **Prospective Study:** Follows participants forward in time and records events as they happen.  
  *Example: Recruit healthy people, track who develops disease over the years.*

***

### 4. **Conditional Probability and Confounding**
- **Conditional Probability:** Probability that one event will occur given that another HAS happened (used to analyze risk factors).
- **Confounding:** A hidden variable affects both the cause and the effect, making it seem like there is a direct link.
  - *Example:* Ice cream sales and drowning—both go up in summer, but summer is the confounder.

***

### 5. **Simpson’s Paradox in Depth**
- **Description:**  
  - Analysis on subgroups/different slices of data can show the opposite trend to analysis on full data.
- **Practical Advice:**  
  - Always check data both with and without grouping by possible confounders (e.g., age, risk categories).

***

### 6. **AI in Healthcare: Potential and Pitfalls**
#### Types of Failures
- **Biased Data:** Training data does not represent all populations (e.g., an AI for skin cancer trained only on light skin fails on dark skin).
- **Epistemic Failure:** Model makes confident predictions on things it was never trained (e.g., confusing Covid for a cat).
- **Regulatory Failure:** No clear rules for safe deployment, leading to risk and uncertainty.
- **Human Error:** Misinterpreting the output, overtrusting or misunderstanding limitations.
- **Disinformation:** AI tools can be misused to produce fake, misleading or harmful medical information at speed.

#### Case Studies
- *Pneumonia/Asthma Example* (Caruana et al. 2015):
  - A model wrongly concluded asthma patients with pneumonia have *lower risk*.
  - Why? These patients got much more intensive care, so the data reflected better outcomes, not a lower biological risk.
- *Dedicated AI vs. LLMs for Diagnosis (2025 study):*
  - Dedicated medical expert systems (built for years) still slightly outperform general-purpose LLMs (like ChatGPT, Gemini) for clinical case diagnosis, especially without lab results.
  - When labs are included, differences narrow.

#### The “Halo Effect”:
- People often over-trust complex models just because they are “deep” or “new”—not always justified.
- Transparent, interpretable models are essential in medicine, even if their accuracy is a bit lower.

***

### 7. **Disinformation and the “Misinfodemic”**
- **Infodemia:** Rapid spread of too much info—much of it incorrect/dangerous.
- **Recent Observations:**
  - Researchers made 102 fake medical blog posts with lots of disinfo using an LLM in about an hour.
  - Posts targeted specific groups and used fake testimonials and references.
  - Images were fabricated in minutes.
- **Lesson:**  
  - AI speeds up the spread of fake health information (“weapons of mass disinformation”).
  - We need transparency, human vigilance, regulatory oversight, and robust “guardrails” to prevent harm.

***

### 8. **Open Discussion: Who Benefits from Health Data?**
- **Beneficiaries:**
  - Patients (better diagnosis/care), policymakers, researchers, tech companies, public health systems.
- **Risks:**  
  - Misuse of sensitive health info, spread of harmful fake news, bias against vulnerable groups.

***

### 9. **Key Takeaways**
- **Always consider data context and structure before trusting analytic results.**
- **AI in medicine needs interdisciplinary knowledge, careful design, and oversight.**
- **Transparent, fair, and ethical use of health data benefits everyone—but misuse can be dangerous.**
- **Understanding bias, confounding, and paradoxes like Simpson’s Paradox is crucial for trustworthy medical computing.**

## Computing for Medicine, Lecture 3: Data Sources  
*(Based on C4M-Lecture-3_Data_Sources_compressed.pdf)*

***

### 1. **Who Benefits from Health Data?**
- Patients receive better diagnosis and treatment.
- Healthcare providers improve care quality and coordination.
- Researchers advance medical knowledge.
- Policymakers design effective health interventions.
- The public gains from better health systems and disease control.

***

### 2. **Starting Point: Healthcare Data**
- Healthcare data often starts with **patient records** from visits.
- Example of a medical record:
  - Patient symptoms: cough, fever, dyspnea.
  - Physical exam results: blood pressure, pulse, fever measurement.
  - Lab data: blood tests, fecal occult blood.
  - Imaging: chest X-rays.
  - Medications prescribed and dosage.
  - Follow-up visits with changes in symptoms and tests.
- These records have multiple problems tracked over time, showing progression and treatment response.

***

### 3. **FAIR Principles for Medical Data**
- To **Make Healthcare Data Reproducible and FAIR**:   
  - **Findable:** Assign **unique, permanent IDs** and rich metadata.  
  - **Accessible:** Data must be retrievable with open, standard methods; even if data is removed, metadata stays available.  
  - **Interoperable:** Use common languages/vocabularies that all systems can understand and link to other data.  
  - **Reusable:** Clear licenses, provenance (history of data), and community standards ensure data can be safely reused.

***

### 4. **Why Use Standards?**
- Standards allow the **same medical vocabulary** to be shared across systems. 
- For example, coding systems like:
  - **ICD-10:** International Classification of Diseases for diagnoses.
  - **SNOMED CT:** Detailed clinical terms.
  - **LOINC:** Laboratory test codes.
  - **RxNorm:** Drug prescriptions.
  - **HL7, FHIR:** Standards for exchanging data electronically.
- With standards, computers can **understand and process** medical records accurately.

***

### 5. **How Does a Computer Read a Medical Record?**
- Medical records are converted into **standardized codes** and data formats.
- Example of one visit:
  - Patient characteristics encoded: 60 years old, male, obese.
  - Symptoms and tests coded with SNOMED CT or LOINC.
  - Diagnosis coded with ICD-10.
  - Medication coded with RxNorm.
- This enables computers to:
  - Store the data.
  - Exchange it with other systems.
  - Use it for analysis or decision support.

***

### 6. **Structured vs. Unstructured Data**
| Type              | Description                         | Example                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Structured Data    | Organized in clear fields, tables  | ICD codes, prescriptions, vitals  |
| Unstructured Data  | Free text or reports               | Doctor's notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports |

- Both types are important; structured data is easier for computers, but unstructured data contains rich clinical details.

***

### 7. **What is an Electronic Health Record (EHR)?**
- *ISO Definition:* An EHR is a securely stored, computer-processable collection of a patient's health info.
- It supports ongoing healthcare and includes data from past, current, and future care.
- Accessible by authorized providers to improve quality and coordination.
- Contains diverse data: consultations, tests, prescriptions, referrals, hospital stays, and more.

***

### 8. **Purpose of EHRs Across Countries**
- Examples:
  - **Australia’s HealthConnect:** Focus on patient care, quality, and management.
  - **Austria’s ELGA system:** Includes patient care and financial/administrative workflows.
- Common goals:
  - Improve patient care.
  - Help doctors make informed decisions.
  - Facilitate research.
  - Reduce errors and streamline workflows.

***

### 9. **Interoperability in Healthcare**
- **Definition (IEEE 1990):** Ability of systems to exchange and use information.
- **Levels of interoperability:**
  - *Technical:* Ability to send/receive data.
  - *Semantic:* Recipient understands the data.
  - *Process:* Data is used effectively in workflows.
  - *Human/Clinical:* Effective use improves patient care.
- Interoperability **enables AI, big data**, better medical communication, research, and global cooperation.

***

### 10. **Examples of Interoperability Standards**
- **HL7 ADT messages** (for patient admissions, transfers, discharges).
- **FHIR Standard** uses JSON format to exchange medical data in APIs.
- These allow efficient, standardized data exchange across healthcare IT systems.

***

### 11. **Key Open Health Datasets**

Thanks for reading!
## Computing for Medicine, Lecture 4: Semantic Interoperability  
*(Based on C4M-Lecture-4_Semantic_Interoperability_compressed.pdf)*

***

### 1. **What is Interoperability?**
- **Definition:** The ability of different systems or components to *exchange information* and *use* the exchanged information effectively.
- **Levels of Interoperability:**
  - **Technical:** Systems can send/receive data.
  - **Semantic:** Systems understand the meaning of data received.
  - **Process:** Data is used properly in workflows or decisions.
  - **Human (Clinical):** Data improves patient care in meaningful ways.

*Semantic interoperability is key to making digital medicine effective by ensuring data is not just exchanged but also *understood*.*

***

### 2. **Why Semantic Interoperability Matters**
- Many medical data sets today are isolated in incompatible systems.
- Lack of interoperability slows medical progress.
- Technologies like AI, big data analytics, and mobile apps depend on interoperable, meaningful data.
- Broad domains impacted:
  - Artificial intelligence and big data.
  - Medical communication among caregivers.
  - Research that combines data across institutions.
  - International cooperation on diseases and treatments.

***

### 3. **Sharing Patient Data to Improve Care**
- Studies show *electronic health information exchange* among hospitals improves coordination.
- Patients benefit as providers share data quickly, reducing repeated tests and errors.
- Hospitals active in Health Information Organizations (HIOs) more often share patient care successfully.

***

### 4. **Semantic Interoperability with Text**
- Medical data often comes as *unstructured text* (e.g., clinical notes).
- To make use of such data:
  - Extract meaningful terms.
  - Turn them into standardized forms computers can analyze.
- Example clinical note about allergies includes symptoms, medication history, and doctor assessments in narrative form.
- Semantic tools help computers interpret this kind of textual, complex data.

***

### 5. **Terminologies and Ontologies: Tools for Semantic Interoperability**

| Term                | What It Means                                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Terminology**      | Standardized set of terms to describe a domain (e.g. medicine).      |
| **Thesaurus**        | Groups similar or related words to help with searching.               |
| **Controlled Vocabulary** | A list of preferred terms that limits variation for consistency. |
| **Classification**   | Organizes terms into mutually exclusive groups (e.g., ICD codes).     |
| **Ontology**         | Defines concepts and relationships formally for computers to reason about. |

- Ontologies are the most powerful, representing concepts, attributes, and relationships logically to help machines deeply understand data.

***

### 6. **Common Clinical Ontologies and Terminologies**

| Use Case                   | Ontology/Standard                                                | Examples                                |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Diagnoses                  | SNOMED CT, ICD, Orphanet, NCIT                                  | Breast carcinoma, Rare genetic diseases|
| Phenotypic abnormalities   | Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)                                  | Specific clinical symptoms              |
| Medications                | RxNorm, DrugBank, ChEMBL                                        | Panobinostat (a drug)                   |
| Adverse drug reactions     | Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE)                                | Injection-site reaction                 |
| Procedures                 | Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)           | Cardiac surgery                        |
| Lab tests                  | LOINC                                                           | Serum creatinine measurement            |
| Imaging data               | DICOM, RadLex                                                   | Bone thinning in X-rays                 |

***

### 7. **What are Ontologies?**
- Ontologies provide both a **shared vocabulary** and the **rules/constraints** for how those terms relate.
- They define:
  - Concepts (things like diseases, symptoms).
  - Attributes (characteristics like severity, location).
  - Relationships (e.g., a disease *affects* a body part).
- Use **description logic** to allow computers to reason about data meaningfully.

***

### 8. **SNOMED CT: A Key Clinical Ontology**
- Most comprehensive clinical healthcare terminology worldwide.
- Used in over 80 countries for EHR documentation and reporting.
- Includes >300,000 concepts grouped into 10 axes:
  - Topography (body parts)
  - Morphology (cell/tissue changes)
  - Organisms (bacteria, viruses)
  - Chemicals and drugs
  - Signs and symptoms
  - Diagnoses
  - Procedures
  - Social context and jobs
  - Devices and agents
  - General qualifiers
- Concepts have:
  - Unique machine-readable IDs.
  - Human-readable names (Fully Specified Name and synonyms).
  - Relationships to define meaning precisely.
- Allows *pre-coordinated* terms (single codes) or *post-coordinated* expressions (combining codes for more detail).

***

### 9. **How Ontologies Help Computer Understand Clinical Data**
- Example: Viral pneumonia defined as
  - A type of infective pneumonia.
  - Caused by a virus.
  - Found in the lungs.
- This logical structure helps in advanced querying, inference, and decision support.

***
